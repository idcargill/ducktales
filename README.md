# DjangoX

## Duck tracker

Keep track of your ducks.  Or delete them when you eat them. 

## Project bootstrapped with

[DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox)

(not recommended)

### Testing

Issues with testing due to static assets.

I will not spend any more time debugging a framework.\
I suggest you don't either, don't use DjangoX.
